"So theory isn’t dead, yet, but it is changing – perhaps beyond recognition."
TRUE

Psychologist Tom Griffiths used neural nets to help him on existing theories. Critics
point out that neural nets can throw up spurious correlatins when the training datasets
are small or biased. Scientists including Isaac Newton had to have an underlying hypothesis
to have the ability to ignore some data. Human intuition proves to be vital in shaping hypothesis,
but AI is useful in refining the theories as with Griffiths.
