I found it interesting that self driving cars could reduce urban vehicle nubmers
by as much as 90%. People effeciently sharing cars would disrupt the vehicle manufacturing
industry, petroleum industry and insurance industry. I wonder what effects this would have to
the economy. It is clear pollution, congestion and accidents would go down.

I would be glad to have autonomous vehicles that strictly follow rules on the road reducing
accidents. I love to sleep in the car and now I would be able to comfortably as cars would be
better designed for comfort.

Most individuals will readily embrace the convience. The main resistance might come from
regulations and existing industries fighting to stay afloat.

Self driving cars will make people less of petrol heads since we are not the ones driving. 
This in turn would make the spread of electric vehicles faster. Our priorities when selecting a
car will likely switch heavily to comfort than performance.
