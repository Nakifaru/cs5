Since each qubits represents 2 states at once, the general formula
for number to be represented by N qubits is 2**N. Thus 100 qubits
represent 1.267*10**30 and 280 qubits represent 1.943*10**84. 
Marissa Giustina, Google quantum electronics engineer:
Quantum computation is about building and controlling a “programmable molecule,” then using it to simulate and ask questions of nature.
I really like this at it explains the importance of harnesing quantum computing:
to model the universe more accurately and get a better understanding.
