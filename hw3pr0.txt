Are we actually in a simulation? Yes? No? Maybe...? Why do you think so (or not)?

We are more likely in a simulation. The observation that mathematical concepts are objective, necessary and timeless.
This leads to the conclusion that mathematic laws are predefined and we are simply discovering them. From the argument of 
Nick Bostrom, if beings figured out how to make a simulation, there would be many simulations made meaning most realities in such
a setting would be simulations, likely our world being one of them. I believe a conclusive answer will be arrived at when we are able to make
a perfect simulation ourselves.
