# Example0 is an example program that 
#   00: asks the user for one input, r1
#   01: computes r2 = r1*r1  (squares it)
#   02: computes r2 = r2 + r1 (adds the original)
#   03: writes out r2, then        04: halts 

00 read r0          # get number from user to r1
01 jumpn 0
02 calln r0, 0
03 write r2         # print what's in r2
04 halt             # stop
