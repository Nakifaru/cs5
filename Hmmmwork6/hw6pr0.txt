In The Education of a Computer, Hopper lists two drawbacks of "using subroutines,"
that is, of abstracting computation into reusable functions. 
Do you feel those two drawbacks still exist today? How important are they today?

Hopper points to time lost in performing duplicate data transfer. With modern
computation power, this time has been reduced to negligible. She further points 
to the small number of subroutines available. Modern programming languages are
well structured with compilers to abstract virtually all functions. There are further
numerous libraries that can be imported with lots of functions.
