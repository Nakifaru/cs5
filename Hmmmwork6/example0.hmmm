# Example0 is an example program that 
#   00: asks the user for one input, r1
#   01: computes r2 = r1*r1  (squares it)
#   02: computes r2 = r2 + r1 (adds the original)
#   03: writes out r2, then        04: halts 

00 read r1          # get number from user to r1
01 mul r2 r1 r1     # r2 = r1 * r1
02 add r2 r2 r1     # r2 = r2 + r1
03 write r2         # print what's in r2
04 halt             # stop
