In my opinion, the most preventable contributing factor to the bug was 
leaving the function running for the first 40 seconds of flight. If this
was made to go off immediately after launch, the rocket would never achieve
higher speeds that the function was not build to anticipate and hence it 
would also not require changes with more advancements leading to higher speeds of rockets.
Truly, software does not fail in the same system as a mechanical system. We can not point
to a specific part and site it as the issue. Software is dependent on each other. Failure is
of the whole system as it is built on itself not external parts. This is why testing is a key part of 
software engineering.
