Name: Michael Mumo (individual project)

Project description: We are the creators of an empty 2 dimensional world 25 by 25 spaces. In this world we place picobot,
a creature whose mandate is to travel through all the spaces in the world. Through a simulation of evolution, picobot gets 
better and better at covering spaces till we pick the best code of life for picobot.
