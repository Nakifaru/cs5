For you, how much of a difference is there between growing - or evolving - software versus designing - or writing - software?   
In what ways does the grow/design distinction change your opinions about the software - or not?

Growing changes the aspect from creating a certain intended behaviour, to having unpredictable behaviour. 
This switches the role of computer scientists such as the researchers at Anthropic to studying software 
as opposed to making software. From the studies it shows that we are still developing methods to find
where hallucinations come from. I initially found it hard to term Computer Science as a science, however
the evolving of sofware is forcing me to reconsider my thoughts.
