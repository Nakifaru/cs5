As stated, the introduction of computers to learning chess did not deter human players but made them better.
This can be seen in other sectors such as art where artists can now make better digital art rather than being replaced
and education where students still need teachers despite having AI. 

Likewise our aesthetic intution as humans can limit us as we are unable to see deeper patterns. This can be thought of 
in automated cars vs humans, where humans reactions in accidents might be to simply turning away from a danger without much 
thought of where they are headed to which might cause a worse accident, as compared to automated cars that can analyze a lot
of data around it and make the best decision.
